# [Diversity & Inclusion Unconference](https://pydata.org/nyc2017/diversity-inclusion/disc-unconference-2017/)

## Nov 29-30, NYC
NumFOCUS recognizes that the open source data science community is currently highly homogenous. We believe that diverse contributors and community members produce better science and better projects. NumFOCUS’s Diversity & Inclusion in Scientific Computing (“DISC”) Program strives to help create a more diverse community through initiatives and programming devoted to increasing participation by and inclusion of underrepresented people. As part of the DISC Program, we are proud to announce the inaugural DISC Unconference at PyData NYC 2017.
