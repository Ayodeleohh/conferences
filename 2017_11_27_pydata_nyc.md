### About PyGotham 

PyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.

We aim to be an accessible, community-driven conference, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.

PyData is organized by—and all proceeds benefit—NumFOCUS, a US 501(c)(3) public charity. Proceeds are used for the continued development of open-source tools used by data scientists and the advancement of the NumFOCUS mission to promote sustainable high-level programming languages, open code development, and reproducible scientific research.
