# Write/Speak/Code

The Write/Speak/Code conference is back in NYC this year! Women & non-binary coders, lets take your career to the next level.

## About
Write/Speak/Code is an intensive, four-day, hands-on conference with workshops, personalized feedback sessions, panels, and talks by talented women and non-binary coders. Each day of the conference is themed: Write/Visibility Day, Speak/Leadership Day, Code/Project Day and Growth. Attendees leave the conference having developed blog posts, conference talks, open source contributions, and more. We provide actionable next steps and a supportive community to keep attendees accountable to the goals they set at the conference and beyond.

We’d love for you to be involved:

Come to our conference: (NYC Aug 1-4) info here (http://www.writespeakcode.com/2018/index.html).

## CFP
Submit a talk proposal to our CFP: (http://bit.ly/wsc-18-cfp) - deadline May 5th.

We welcome first time speakers. All selected speakers will receive a free ticket to the conference. We’ll also be offering $100-250 honorariums based on talk format.

What makes our conference unique is that our conference is beginner friendly but also attracts a diverse group of people: last year the average years of software experience was 7 years and 40% of our women were women of color. We offer free childcare, ASL/CART services, and accommodate all requests for accessibility.
