# About
The PyCon 2018 conference, which will take place in Cleveland, is the largest annual gathering for the community using and developing the open-source Python programming language. It is produced and underwritten by the Python Software Foundation, the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing and promoting Python. Through PyCon, the PSF advances its mission of growing the international community of Python programmers.

Because PyCon is backed by the non-profit PSF, we keep registration costs much lower than comparable technology conferences so that PyCon remains accessible to the widest group possible. The PSF also pays for the ongoing development of the software that runs PyCon and makes it available under a liberal open source license. The PSF has paid staff to manage PyCon. Two employees work on planning and two employees work on the financial aspects of PyCon.

PyCon is a diverse conference dedicated to providing an enjoyable experience to everyone. Help us do this by following our code of conduct.
